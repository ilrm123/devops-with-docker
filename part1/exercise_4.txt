Command used to run container:

docker run -it ubuntu sh -c 'while true; do echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website; done'


Commands in a different terminal used to install missing dependency:

docker run exec <container> apt-get update
docker run exec <container> apt-get -y install curl


After these the curl now works and shows the html.
